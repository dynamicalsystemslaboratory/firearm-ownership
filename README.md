The datasets and codes presented herein, replicate the results reported in Barak Ventura et al. 2022, "A spatiotemporal model of firearm ownership in the United States", Patterns, 3(8): 100546 (DOI: 10.1016/j.patter.2022.100546). All analyses were made in Matlab version R2020_a.

# spatial-model
The files under "spatial-model" use raw data to calibrate spatial econometric models that estimate state-level firearm ownership every month between January 2000 and October 2019, based on the count of background checks and number of suicides committed with firearms.

# causal-analysis
The files under "causal-analysis" implement transfer entropy analysis to infer causal relationships between three variables at a time.

# datasets
The "datasets" folder contains the model's output for firearm ownership, the processed output following seasonal adjustment and linear detrending, and additional data sets that are pertinent for replication of the study.

The files under "spatial-model" use raw data to calibrate a spatial econometric model that estimates state-level firearm ownership every month between January 2000 and October 2019, based on the count of background checks and number of suicides committed with firearms. 

The "datasets" folder contains the model's output for firearm ownership, as well as the processed output following seasonal adjustment and linear detrending.
